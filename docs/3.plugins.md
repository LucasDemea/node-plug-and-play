# Plugins registration

A plugin groups multiple hooks in a same place. As such, it must exports at least one hook inside the `hooks` property.

# Structure

A plugin is an object literal with the properties:

* `hooks` ({name: hook})   
  List of hooks identified by hook names.
* `name` (string)   
  Name of the plugin.
* `require` ([string])   
  Names of the required plugins.

Alternatively, a plugin can be defined as a function which returns the same plugin object and receive the `args` property from the Plug-And-Play function.

## Registration

Plug and Play can be initialized with a list of plugins through the `plugins` options:

```js
import { plugandplay } from 'plug-and-play'
plugandplay({
  plugins: [{
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => { console.log('"my:hook" is called') }
    }
  }]
})
```

Or later on with the `register` function:

```js
import { plugandplay } from 'plug-and-play'
plugandplay()
.register({
  plugins: [{
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => { console.log('"my:hook" is called') }
    }
  }]
})
```
