# Introduction

Plug and Play is a tool targetting library and application authors to introduce a plugin architecture in their Node.js source code.

It simplifies complex code execution with well-defined interception points, we call them hooks, and it provides the library users the ability to extends, fix, and alter the execution flow of a code without changing it.

The library is released on [the NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plug-and-play) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/adaltas/node-plug-and-play/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Module system

The library supports both ESM and CommonJS. Whichever the module system, it exports a `plugandplay` function to create a new instance.

With ESM:

```js
import { plugandplay } from 'plug-and-play'
```

With CommonJS:

```js
const { plugandplay } = require('plug-and-play')
```

Note, internally, the code is written in ESM.

## History

It was originally developped inside [Shell](https://shell.js.org/), a CLI toolkit, and was later enhanced inside [Nikita](https://nikita.js.org), an automation and deployment toolkit.
