# Initialize a new instance

## Instantiation

The `plugandplay` export is a function which accepts an `option` object with the properties:

* `args` ([...any])   
  Array of arguments passed to plugins when they are initialized as a function.
* `chain` (any)   
  Value returned by Plug-And-Play `register` function, default to the Plug-And-Play instance.
* `parent` (plugandplay)   
  Parent Plug and Play instance to inherit plugins, unless sorted with `after` and `before`, child hooks are executed before the parent hooks by default.
* `plugins` ([plugin])   
  List of plugins to be initially registered. Plugins can later be registered with the `register` function.

Note, all options are optional.

For example:

```js
plugandplay({
  args: [config, state]
  plugins: [(config, state) => ({
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => {}
    }
  })]
  parent: parentPlugAndPlayInstance
})
```

# Option `args`

The `args` option defines an array of arguments used to instantiate a plugin when it is defined as a function. Thus, only plugins defined as functions leverage this option.

It is commonly used to pass a configuration object or a state to your plugins.

Assuming you wish to pass a configuration to your plugins, in this case the `print-config` plugin, you may initialize your library with:

```js
import { plugandplay } from 'plug-and-play'
import printConfig from "my-package/plugins/print-config.js"

const config = {
  'hero': 'gollum'
}

export default function engine () {
  const plugins = new plugandplay({
    args: [config]
    plugins: printConfig
  })
  // ...
}
```

Registered plugins, like the `print-config` plugin discoverable somewhere with `my-package/plugins/print-config.js`, receive the `config` object on instantiation:

```js
export default function (config) {
  return {
    hooks: {
      'my:hook': () => {
        console.log(`Configuration is ${JSON.stringify(config)}`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
