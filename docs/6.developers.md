## Publishing

To automatically generate a new version:

```bash
yarn run release
```

There is currently no CI, copy/paste the code after release. Note, commits and tags are automatically pushed before publishing.

```bash
npm publish
```

## Unit test

Unit tests are written and executed with Mocha and Should.js. Run `npm run test` to execute the all test suite.
